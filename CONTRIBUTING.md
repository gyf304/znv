## How to contribute to znv

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by checking the [list of open
  issues](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new
  one](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv/issues/new). Be sure to include a
  **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and
  a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected
  behavior that is not occurring.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include
  the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Run `yarn test` before submitting the pull request to ensure tests, linting
  and formatting pass without issues. These will also be checked in CI, so it
  can save you time later.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Check if the feature is already in development or up for discussion in an
  [open issue](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv/issues) or [pull
  request](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv/pulls).

- If not, consider [opening a new
  issue](https://github.com/lostfictions/znv/issues/new) to discuss your
  proposed change before putting the work in to make a pull request.

- Pull requests that change substantial functionality may be considered without
  prior discussion, but will likely be scrutinized more carefully.

### Do you want to contribute to the documentation?

- Please do! Feel free to submit pull requests to the README to correct errors
  or add additional context.
